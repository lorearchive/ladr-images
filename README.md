# ladr-images

This is the GitHub repository used by [Lore Archive's Dialogue Reader for Blue Archive](https://github.com/lorearchive/LADR) to display backdrop images used in-game onto the web. They are fetched upon user request (when site first loads) then cropped into appropriate dimensions using Javascript.
